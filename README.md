        this.description = "A command that can do cool stuff."; // The description of the command.
        this.aliases = []; // An array of strings *optional*

        this.guildOnly = true; // Set this to false if you want it to be ran in pms
        this.ownerOnly = false; // Set this to true if you want the bot owner to be the one who can run this command.
